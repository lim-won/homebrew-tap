  # RUNTIME dependency — the bridge degrades to hook/phone-only when cmux is absent.

  # `brew services start cmux-iphone` runs the CORE bridge as a per-user
  # LaunchAgent (hooks + phone API + Codex). The cmux LIVE MIRROR is NOT covered
  # here — a launchd process can't drive the cmux control socket; for that, run
  # `cmux-iphone setup` with cmux present (it registers an in-cmux workspace).

      Next steps:
        cmux-iphone setup     # register Claude hooks + choose runner + print pairing code
        cmux-iphone doctor    # diagnostics

      cmux users: `cmux-iphone setup` runs the bridge inside cmux (live mirror).
      Without cmux you can instead: brew services start cmux-iphone

      After `brew upgrade cmux-iphone`, re-run `cmux-iphone setup` once so the
      LaunchAgent / cmux workspace re-point at the new version.
